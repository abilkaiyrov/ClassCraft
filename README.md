Purpose/Vision: Create a mobile virtual reality application that can teach children academic skills in a fun and unique way using low cost hardware. The lessons provided will be consistent with California State Education standards and should be easy to create and modify as needed.

Description: The application will be an educational tool first and foremost that uses a game setting to introduce, teach and reinforce the concepts introduced in the lesson. Our initial audience for the application is first grade level with a math lesson and a spelling lesson available. Each lesson should run for approximately 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes of content.

The application will be built using Unity3D and C#. Initial software and hardware compatibility will be with the Android OS and Daydream headset and controller with the option to add more device compatibility as time and resources allow.

We have multiple stretch goals identified that include creating resources for teachers that include progress tracking for student and lesson selection. To implement this we would create a database and desktop client application to access and modify student information. Another stretch goal we are interested in is implementing machine learning to customize content difficulty based on student performance.
